# Neutral Hostiles
A Datapack for Peaceful Minecraft Players who dislike monsters ruining their experience.

## Credits
This Minecraft Datapack is created by Sam L. (SamL2020)

Some aspects of the datapack were generated with https://advancements.thedestruc7i0n.ca/

Minecraft is a game made by Mojang. https://minecraft.net

## Purpose
Minecraft is a fun sandbox game, but it can get scary and annoying for some players with hostile mobs. Turing the game difficulty to peaceful just won't fix it,  you can't get hostile drops like Blaze rods, and it is too easy for some players.

That's why I've made this Datapack, it allows Hostile Mobs to exist. They will not harm you until you harm them. This Datapack allows for challenges in resource gathering with hostile mobs, but have not made it too easy or impossible.

## How to use
Datapacks are simple to install, simply [Download the Latest Release](https://github.com/SamL2020/neutral-hostiles/releases/latest) as a `.ZIP`. 

Put it in your world folder (Under `saves/<world name>/datapacks`) and use the `/reload` command ingame!
A message should pop up and you're ready to go!
